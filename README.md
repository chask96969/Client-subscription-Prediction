# Client-subscription-Prediction
This model is targetted to predict if a user will subscribe to the term deposit or not.
I have considered univariate and bi-variate analysis.
I found people of age groups 20-40 will have higher chances of subcribing and it is most likely to people to subscribe who doesn't have any history of deposites.
The call duration also has impacted the target variable as longer the user speaks to agent,the higher the chances of subscribing.
By using Logistic Regression,Decision tree algorithm, the accuracy score I got is 89% and 90% respectively.
This project can be further extended to train the models with Random forest,support vector machine,etc.
